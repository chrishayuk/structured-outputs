        "1) sudoku_puzzle: the 9x9 array of integers.\n\n"
        "2) verification_details: an object with:\n"
        "   - lines_verification: a list of 9 arrays, each array describing that row's checks in a detailed, paragraph-like format. "
        "     For example, you might include a heading like 'A. Verify Each Row', a short explanation, and then for each row:\n"
        "       'Row 1: 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2 -> SUCCESS', "

        "   - subgrids_verification: a list of 9 arrays, also detailed. For instance:\n"

        "IMPORTANT:\n"
        " - Each of the arrays (lines_verification, columns_verification, subgrids_verification) must have exactly 9 elements.\n"
        " - Each element can contain a multi-sentence explanation if needed, but store it as a single string.\n"
        " - Clearly state if there's a duplicate, e.g., 'Row 2 -> ERROR: digit 3 appears twice'.\n"
        " - The final output must be valid JSON that exactly matches the SudokuVerificationPlan schema.\n"
